    "# US EPA Air Quality System AQI Data Acquisition and Processing \n",
    "The code below illustrates how to request data from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Air Quality Service (AQS) API. This is a historical API and does not provide real-time air quality data. The [documentation](https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/documents/data_api.html) for the API provides definitions of the different call parameter and examples of the various calls that can be made to the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook works systematically through calls, requesting an API key, using 'list' to get various IDs and parameter values, and using 'daily summary' to get summary data that meets specific conditions. \n",
    "\n",
    "The US EPA was created in the early 1970's. The EPA reports that they only started broad based monitoring with standardized quality assurance procedures in the 1980's. Many counties will have data starting somewhere between 1983 and 1988. Specifically, my county Maricopa (for assigned city Mesa, AZ) has data starting from 1965. Some [additional information on the Air Quality System can be found in the EPA FAQ](https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data/frequent-questions-about-airdata) on the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The AQI index is meant to tell us something about how healthy or clean the air is on any day. The AQI is actually a somewhat complext measure. When I started this example I looked up [how to calculate the AQI](https://www.airnow.gov/sites/default/files/2020-05/aqi-technical-assistance-document-sept2018.pdf) so that I would know roughly what goes into that value.\n",

This API approach is probably better than having the EPA publish documentation that may be out of date as soon as it hits a web page.
